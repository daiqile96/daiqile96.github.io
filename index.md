## About Me

- I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in Biostatistics with extensive experience in AI/ML and statistical modeling gained through 6+ years of
research and 2 internships at GSK and Johnson & Johnson. 

- **Interests:** Bayesian statistics, causal inference, machine learning, statistical genetics and genomics, and clinical trials.

<!-- ## Education

- **Emory University**  
  *Ph.D. in Biostatistics*  
  Aug 2020 - May 2025 (Expected)   
- **Yale University**  
  *M.S. in Biostatistics*  
  Aug 2018 - May 2020  
- **University of International Business and Economics**  
  *B.S. in Statistics*  
  Aug 2014 - Jun 2018
  
## Professional Experience

- **Johnson & Johnson**  
  *Data Science Intern*  
  Spring House, PA  
  **May 2024 - Aug 2024**  
  - Designed a machine learning framework leveraging Random Forest and PageRank to predict drug toxicity.  
  - Implemented the framework using Python (Scikit-learn, NetworkX), improving prediction precision by 5%.  
  - Selected as a highlighted oral presenter (top 10%) at the J&J Summer Intern Research Symposium.  

- **GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)**  
  *Statistician Intern*  
  Remote  
  **May 2023 - Aug 2023**  
  - Designed a hypothesis testing framework leveraging Bayesian regressions to facilitate drug discovery.  
  - Automated a pipeline using SQL and R for efficient data acquisition, model training, and visualization.  
  - Applied the framework to a dataset with over 500,000 samples and 200,000 features across 17 diseases, improving drug target identification precision from 42% to 60%.  

## Research Experience

- **Emory School of Public Health**  
  *Graduate Researcher*  
  Atlanta, GA  
  **Aug 2020 - Present**  
  - **Project 1: Regression using Summary-level Statistics**  
    - Designed a Bayesian regression framework that uses summary-level statistics to address data privacy issues.  
    - Developed a Python package for efficient parallel data processing and model training.  
    - Published results in *Nature Communications*.  
  - **Project 2: Multi-Dimensional Tensor Data Analysis**  
    - Developed an R package using supervised tensor decomposition for gene expression analysis.  
  - **Project 3: Alzheimerâ€™s Risk Prediction with Time-Series Data**  
    - Employed recurrent neural networks (LSTM) in Python (Scikit-learn, PyTorch) to predict brain pathologies using longitudinal clinical features, increasing prediction accuracy by 15%. -->
